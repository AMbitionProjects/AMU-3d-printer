## Overview
The "Additive Maunfacturing Unit" is an open source 3D printer project that aims to be relativley simple to source and build. Feel free to use this design for your own purpose.

This is a work in progress project. The 3d printer is not built yet, and parts are not guaranteed to fit together. The first build and klipper config is scheduled for august 2024.

## Design Goals
10mm linear rods for all axes
simplified fastener sourcing - all M3 screws are 8/12/20/40mm socket heads, and all M5 screws are 10/15/20mm button heads. Few extra M4 screws for power supply mount
